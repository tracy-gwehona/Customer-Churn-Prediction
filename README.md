## Overview
Customer churn (or the loss of customers) is one of the biggest challenges for telecommunications companies such as SyriaTel because acquiring new customers can be much more expensive than keeping them. High churn rates affect profitability, market share, and long-term expansion. I aim to use  historical customer information to anticipate who is destined to exit. If the company knows the churn pattern, it will be able to apply proactive measures to increase retention and customer satisfaction and keep up with the competition.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholders
SyriaTel Telecommunications Company.

### Business problem
SyriaTel is having customer churn and that is directly impacting revenue and profit. For that, the company must know what causes the customer to be dissatisfied with it. SyriaTel canâ€™t develop retention plans without understanding churn and high-risk customers, , leading to continued customer loss and a decline in market share.

To address this, I aim to:
1. Identify key factors influencing customer churn.
2. Predict customer churn.
3. Provide actionable insights to enable SyriaTel to implement targeted interventions.

## Data Understanding
The dataset in use was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset?resource=download). It contains SyriaTel telecom customers' information such as:
1. Account length.
2. International plan.
3. Voicemail plan.
4. Number of voicemail messages.
5. Total day, evening and night calls, charges and minutes.
6. Customer service calls.
7. Churn. Whether a customer left or not.

This dataset  is a historical record of SyriaTel customer base with features that describe customer behaviour, service usage and interactions with the company.
It includes both behavioural and service attributes directly associated with satisfaction and retention which allows you to find trends that cause churn.
